# ionic-flat-colors

The Ionic Flat Colors adds new colors options for the Ionic components: buttons, bars, checkboxes...etc.

## Requirements

The lib requires Ionic 1.2+ versions.

## Installation

Just download the distribution css file of the lib and put in your project after the
ionic css link tag. Example: 
```html
  <link href="bower_components/ionic/css/ionic.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="css/ionic-flat.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Get started

After add the lib in your project you can use any colors the lib offers in
your Ionic components. Take a look in our doc page for examples and more information.

## Thanks

I'd like to thanks [vbaimas](http://www.vbaimas.com/) all the colors used
are based on his flat colors page.
