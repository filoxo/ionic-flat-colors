    <h1>Ionic Flat Colors</h1>
    <h4>Why this project has been created?</h4>
    <p>
      I created this project to help devs that like me are not so good with design and colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ionic is a great framework to develop hybrid apps, it already come with
      some colors to customize your app but sometimes you need options. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time I started an app with Ionic I always searched on internet some flat color 
      palettes to use and after some searchs I found an website of a designer called "vbaimas", 
      by the way I'd like to thanks him for his work, this project is all based on his flat 
      colors website called http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/ Thanks Vbaimas for you work.

    <h4>So what is the Ionic Flat Colors project?</h4>
    <p>
      The Ionic Flat Colors is an expansion for the Ionic components. The lib gives 
      to you new options of colors for Ionic components to customize your app.
    </p>
    <h4>How can I get started?</h4>
    <p>
      To get started with Ionic Flat Colors is very simple, you just need to download the
      distribution version of the lib and add it in your project after the ionic
      css in your index file. After that you can use all of the classes of the project with the ionic components.

    <h4>
      I have an Ionic project and I want to use the Ionic Flat Colors lib. The lib will break my css code?
    </h4>
    <p>
      No, this project does not change the Ionic default colors, it just adds new options for you
