    <h4>Why this project has been created?</h4>
    <p>
      I created this project to help developers that, like me, are not very good with design and colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ionic is a great framework to develop hybrid apps. It already comes with
      some colors to customize your app, but sometimes you need more options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time I start an app with Ionic I always search on internet for some flat color
      palettes to use and after some searches I always find myself on a website by a designer called "vbaimas".
      I'd like to thank him for his work as this project is based on his flat
      colors website called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/">Flat Ui color Picker</a>. Thanks Vbaimas for you work.

    <h4>So what is the Ionic Flat Colors project?</h4>
    <p>
      The Ionic Flat Colors is an expansion for the Ionic components. The library gives
      you new options of colors for Ionic components to customize your app.
    </p>
    <h4>How can I get started?</h4>
    <p>
      Getting started with Ionic Flat Colors is very simple, you just need to download the
      distribution version of the library and add it to your project after the ionic
      css in your index file. After that you can use all of the classes of the project with the Ionic components.
    </p>
    <h4>
      I have an Ionic project and I want to use the Ionic Flat Colors library. Will the library break my css code?
    </h4>
    <p>
      No, this project does not change the Ionic default colors, it just adds new options for you
